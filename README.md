<i>It’s a battle to stop an invasion! The cube drones made to look like our cube race but are mindless they follow one order “open the portals and ensure they stay open”. The portals have been opened to allow their creators to easily invade; it is up to you The Cube designed by cube scientist with the ability to close the portals by taking the power crystals above the portals. The cube drones have a protection mechanism, they cannot be touched if you come in to contact with them they will pass right through you so focus on you mission which is to close as many portals as possible; the cube drones will continue to re-open closed portals by placing new crystals so keep an eye on the number of closed portals. If things get to tough the scientists have installed what they call a maelstrom device it can be used continually for up to five seconds or in small burst but takes forty seconds to recharge so use it sparingly. You will have ninety-seconds to close the required amount of portals before the cube drones open another wave of portals but if you do not reach the required amount of portals before time it will be mission failed.</i>
